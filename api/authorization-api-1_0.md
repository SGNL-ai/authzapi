--- abstract

The Authorization API enables Policy Decision Points (PDPs) and Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs) to communicate authorization requests and decisions to each other without requiring knowledge of each other's inner workings. The Authorization API is served by the PDP and is called by the PEP. The Authorization API includes an Evaluations endpoint, which provides specific access decisions and a Search endpoint, which provides generalized access capabilities.

--- middle

# Introduction

Computational services often implement access control within their components by separating Policy Decision Points (PDPs) from Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs). PDPs and PEPs are defined in XACML ({{XACML}}). Communication between PDPs and PEPs follows similar patterns across different software and services that require or provide authorization information. The Authorization API described in this document enables different providers to offer PDP and PEP capabilities without having to bind themselves to one particular implementation of a PDP or PEP.

## Model
The Authorization API is a REST API published by the PDP, to which the PEP acts as a client. 

Authorization for the Authorization API itself is out of scope for this document, since authorization for REST APIs is well-documented elsewhere. For example, the Authorization API MAY support authorization using an `Authorization` header, using a `basic` or `bearer` token. Support for OAuth 2.0 ({{RFC6749}}) is RECOMMENDED. 

## Features
The Authorization API has two main features:

* An Access Evaluations API, which enables a PEP to find out if a specific request can be permitted to access specific resources
* A Search API, which enables a PEP to discover all resources that a subject has access to, by specifying conditions for the access

# Terminology

Subject:
: The user or robotic principal about whom the Authorization API call is being made

Resource:
: The target of the request; the resource about which the Authorization API is being made

Action:
: The operation the Subject has attempted on the Resource in an Authorization API call

PDP:
: Policy Decision Point. The component or system that provides authorization decisions over the network interface defined here as the Authorization API

PEP:
: Policy Enforcement Point. The component or system that requests decisions from the PDP and enforces access to specific requests based on the decisions obtained from the PDP

# API Specification
The Authorization API has two parts, Access Evaluation and Search. Each of these is defined below.

## API Version
This document describes the API version 1. Any updates to this API through subsequent revisions of this document or through other documents MAY augment this API, but MUST NOT modify the API described here. Augmentation MAY include additional API methods or additional parameters to existing API methods, additional authorization mechanisms or additional optional headers in API requests. All API methods for version 1 MUST be immediately preceded by the relative URL path `/v1/`.

## API Authorization
API calls SHALL be authorized with OAuth 2.0 access tokens ({{RFC6750}}). Implementors MAY use bearer tokens or sender constrained tokens, depending on the organizations policy.

## Request Identification
All requests to the API MAY have request identifiers to uniquely identify them. The API client (PEP) is responsible for generating the request identifier. If present, the request identifier SHALL be provided using the HTTP Header `X-Request-ID`. The value of this header is an arbitrary string. The following non-normative example describes this header:

~~~ http
POST /access/v1/evaluations HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM
X-Request-ID: bfe9eb29-ab87-4ca3-be83-a1d5d8305716
~~~
{: #requestidexample title="Request Id Example"}

## Request Identification in a Response
A PDP responding to an Authorization API request MUST include a request identifier in the response. The request identifier is specified in the HTTP Response header: `X-Request-ID`. If the PEP specified a request identifier in the request, the PDP MUST include the same identifier in the response to that request. If the PEP has not specified a request identifier in the request, the PDP MUST generate a new request identifier in its response to the PEP. The following is an non-normative example of an HTTP Response with this header:

~~~ http
HTTP/1.1 OK
Content-type: application/json
X-Request-ID: bfe9eb29-ab87-4ca3-be83-a1d5d8305716
~~~
{: #example-response-request-id title="Example HTTP response with a Request Id"}

## Subjects {#subjects}
A Subject is the user or robotic principal about whom the Authorization API is being invoked. The Subject may be requesting access at the time the Authorization API is invoked, or the Subject may be of interest in a Search API call.

A Subject is in the format specified by the `Subject Identifiers for Security Event Tokens` specification {{RFC9493}}. A Subject MUST include at least one identifier, but MAY include more than one identifier if the format of the field is of type `aliases`.

The following new Subject Identifier Formats SHALL be added to the `Security Event Identifier Formats Registry` IANA Repository, as defined in the {{IANA}} section below:

### IP Address {#subject-ip-address}
The IP Address of the Subject. The IP Address Subject Identifier Format is identified by the name `ip_address`. It identifies the IP Address of the subject, identified with an `ip_address` field, whose value is a textual representation of an IP Address, as defined in `Textual Conventions for Internet Network Addresses` {{RFC4001}}.

The following is a non-normative example of a Subject Identifier Format of type IP Address:

~~~ json
{
  "format": "ip_address",
  "ip_address": "172.217.22.14"
}
~~~
{: #ipaddresssubjectexample title="Example IP Address format Subject Identifier"}

### Device Identifier {#subject-device-id}
The Device Identifier of the Subject. The Device Identifier Subject Identifier Format is identified by the name `device_id`. It identifies the Device Identifier of the subject, identified with a `device_id` field, whose value is a string representation of the device identifier.

The following is a non-normative example of a Subject Identifier Format of type  Device Identifier:

~~~ json
{
  "format": "device_id",
  "device_id": "8:65:ee:17:7e:0b"
}
~~~
{: #deviceidssubjectexample title="Example Device Identifier format Subject Identifier"}

### Multiple Subject Identifier Formats {#subject-multi-format}
A Subject may be described using multiple formats, using the `aliases` Subject Identifier Format. The individual subject identifiers within the `aliases` Subject Identifier Format are interpreted to mean different attributes of the same Subject.

The following non-normative example describes a Subject with multiple formats:

~~~ json
{
  "format": "aliases",
  "identifiers": [
    {
      "format": "email",
      "email": "atul@sgnl.ai"
    },
    {
      "format": "ip_address",
      "ip_address": "172.217.22.14"
    },
    {
      "format": "device_id",
      "device_id": "8:65:ee:17:7e:0b"
    }
  ]
}
~~~
{: #subjectexample title="Example Subject Identifier using multiple formats"}

## Resources {#resources}
An Resource is the target of an access request. It is a JSON ({{RFC8259}}) object that has the following fields:

id:
: OPTIONAL. The unique identifier of the resource within the scope of the PEP. Its value is a `string` specifying the identifier of the resource. This field MAY be omitted to indicate a class of resources

type:
: OPTIONAL. The type of the resource. Its value is a `string` that specifies the type of the resource

attributeNames:
: OPTIONAL. An array of `string`s, each string representing the name of an attribute of the resource.

The following is a non-normative example of an Resource:

~~~json
{
    "id": "somevalue",
    "type": "user",
    "attributeNames": [
        "homeAddress",
        "birthDate",
        "employeeId"
    ]
}
~~~
{: #resourceexample title="Example Resource"}

## Actions {#actions}
An action is the type of access that the requester intends to perform. There are common actions defined herein, or the action may be custom, which could be specific to the application being accessed or shared across a applications but not listed in the common actions below

### Common Actions
The following common actions are defined herein:

"access":
: A generic action that could mean any type of access. This is useful if the policy or application is not interested in different decisions for different types of actions

"create":
: The action to create a new entity, which MAY be defined by the `resource` field in the request

"read":
: The action to read the content. Based on the resource being accessed, this could mean a list functionality or reading an individual resource contents

"update":
: The action to update the content of an existing entity. This MAY represent a partial update or an entire replacement of the entity. The entity MAY be identified by the resource in the request

"delete":
: The action to delete an entity. The entity MAY be identified by the resource in the request

Policies MAY incorporate common action names to provide different decisions based on the action

### Custom Actions
Any action that is not one of the above is a custom action. Policies MAY incorporate custom action names if decisions need to be taken differently for different custom actions

## Resource Query {#resource-query}
An Resource Query is a question about whether a subject can access a specific resource. It is a JSON object with the following fields:

action:
: REQUIRED. The type of access that is to be performed. Its value is a `string` that describes the action. This value of this field is as described in the Actions section ({{actions}}).

resource:
: REQUIRED. The resource to which this query relates. Its format is as described in the Resources section ({{resources}})

The following is a non-normative example of an Resource Query:

~~~ json
{
    "action": "stream",
    "resource": {
        "id": "1234",
        "type": "webcam",
        "attributeNames": [
            "lowRes",
            "motionOnly"]
    }
}
~~~
{: #example-resource-query title="Example Resource Query"}

## Decisions
Decisions are provided by the PDP in response to requests from the PEP.

### Query Decision {#query-decision}
A query decision is a JSON `string` which can have one of the following values:

"allow":
: The access request is permitted to go forward

"deny":
: The access request is denied and MUST NOT be permitted to go forward

### Reasons
Reasons MUST be provided by the PDP when the Query Decision is `deny`. 

#### Reason Field {#reason-field}
A Reason Field is a JSON object that has keys and values of type `string`. The key name is comprised of a two-letter language code, and optionally a hyphen followed by a string of decimal digits that is a reason code. The following are non-normative examples of Reason Field objects:

~~~ json
{
    "en": "location restriction violation"
}
~~~
{: #example-reason-field-no-code title="Example Reason Field with no reason code"}

~~~ json
{
    "en" : "Access attempt from multiple regions.",
    "es-410": "Intento de acceso desde varias regiones."
}
~~~
{: #example-reason-field-with-code title="Example Reason Field with reason code and multiple language keys"}

#### Reason Object {#reason-object}
A Reason Object specifies a particular reason. It is a JSON object that has the following fields:

id:
: REQUIRED. A numeric value of that specifies the reason within the scope of a particular response

reason_admin:
: OPTIONAL. The reason, which MUST NOT be shared with the user, but useful for administrative purposes that indicates why the access was denied. The value of this field is a Reason Field object ({{reason-field}}).

reason_user:
: OPTIONAL. The reason, which MAY be shared with the user that indicates why the access was denied. The value of this field is a Reason Field object ({{reason-field}})

The following is a non-normative example of a Reason Object:

~~~json
{
  "id": 0,
  "reason_admin": {
    "en": "Request failed policy C076E82F"
  },
  "reason_user": {
    "en-403": "Insufficient privileges. Contact your administrator",
    "es-403": "Privilegios insuficientes. Póngase en contacto con su administrador"
  }
}
~~~
{: #example-reason-object title="Example of a Reason Object"}

### Resource Query Decision {#resource-query-decision}
An Resource Query Decision is a tuple of an resource, action and a decision, represented as a JSON object. It has the following fields:

action:
: OPTIONAL. The action for which the decision is provided. The format is as described in the Actions section ({{actions}})

resource:
: OPTIONAL. The resource for which the decision is provided. The format is as described in the Resources section ({{resources}}). This resource MAY be greater in scope than described in the Resource Query ({{resource-query}}), i.e. It MAY describe an resource more generally than specified in the Resource Query. However, it MUST NOT be more specific than the resource described in the Resource Query.

decision:
: REQUIRED. The decision for the above `resource` and `action`. The format is as described in the Query Decision section ({{query-decision}})

reason_ids:
: OPTIONAL. An array of reason identifiers that indicate specific resons why the resource query was denied

The following is a non-normative example of an Resource Query Decision:

~~~ json
{
    "action": "stream",
    "resource": {
        "id": "1234"
    },
    "decision": "deny",
    "reason_ids": [0,2,3]
}
~~~
{: #example-resource-query-decision title="Example Resource Query Decision"}

## Collections {#collections}
An API request or response MAY contain a collection of items, such as an array of strings representing various attribute names, or an array of Resource Query Decision objects ({{resource-query-decision}}). The objects in a collection MAY overlap in scope. For example:

~~~ json
[
    {
        "resource": {
            "id": "1234",
            "attributeNames": [
              "homeAddress",
              "title"
            ]
        },
        "decision": "deny",
        "reason_ids": [1]
    },
    {
        "resource": {
            "id": "1234"
        },
        "decision": "allow"
    }
]
~~~
{: #collection-example title="Example Overlapping Collection"}

The receiver of a collection MUST interpret the collection in a way that results in the least-privilege access. In the above example, this means that the subject has access to the resource identified by "1234", but not to the "homeAddress" and "title" attributes of that resource.

## Error Responses
The following error responses are common to all methods of the Authorization API. The error response is indicated by an HTTP status code ({{Section 15 of RFC9110}}) that indicates error.

The following errors are indicated by the status codes defined below:

| Code | Description  | HTTP Body Content |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| 400  | Bad Request  | An error message string |
| 401  | Unauthorized | An error message string |
| 403  | Forbidden    | An error message string |
| 500  | Internal error | An error message string |
{: #table-error-status-codes title="Error status codes"}

## Access Evaluations API
The Access Evaluations API is a means for a PEP to request decisions for a number of resources for a single request context.

The Access Evaluations API is available at the relative URL `/evaluations/` via the `POST` HTTP method.

### Access Evaluation Request
The content of the request body is a JSON Object with the following fields:

subject:
: REQUIRED. A subject as described in the Subjects section ({{subjects}})

queries:
: REQUIRED. An array of queries defined in Resource Query section ({{resource-query}}) about access to specific resources

The following is a non-normative example of an Access Evaluation Request:

~~~ http
POST /evaluations HTTP/1.1
Host: pdp.mycompany.com
Authorization: <myoauthtoken>
X-Request-ID: bfe9eb29-ab87-4ca3-be83-a1d5d8305716

      }
    },
    {
      "action": "read",
      "resource": {
        "id": "efgh",
        "type": "customer",
        "attributeNames": [
          "homeAddress"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
~~~
{: #example-access-evaluation-request title="Example of an Access Evaluation Request"}

### Access Evaluation Response

#### Subject Query Result {#subject-query-result}
A Subject Query Result is array of Subject Query Decisions ({{example-subject-query-decision}}). It is JSON object combining a subject, a list of resource attribute names and an action. Given that a Subject Query result is expected to be the response to a Subject Search, only positive matches should be returned; i.e., only those subjects that match the search criteria (those subjects that are allowed to access the provided Resource Attributes). Any Subjects absent from the results do not have any access to the Resource. 
A Subject Query Result has the following fields:

actions:
: OPTIONAL. An Array of the action for which the decision is provided. The format is as described in the Actions section ({{actions}}). The values in this list should match the values provided as queries in the Subject Search request.

attributeNames:
: OPTIONAL. An Array of attribute names of the resource for which the response applies. The attribute is provided only if attributes were part of the Subject search request. In that case, the attribute names must match those that are part of the request.

subject:
: REQUIRED. The subject for which the decision is provided. The format is as described in the Subjects section ({{subjects}}). 

The following is a non-normative example of a Subject Query Decision:

    "actions": ["delete", "read", "write"],
    "attributeNames": [
        "author",
        "createDate",
